A package for aesthetically pleasing and colorblindness-friendly color schemes

Copyright 2025 Ethan Dintzner

A collection of several hundred multicolor palettes from Color Inspirations by Darius A. Monsef IV.[1] 
Additionally includes a series of functions that allow you to browse color pallets, test colorblind friendliness for inbuilt or custom pallets, produce matplotlib-compatible continuous colormaps, and convert from RGB to HEX.

Below is an example of using this package:
```
import colorschemes as cs

ColorSchemes = cs.colorschemes()

```
